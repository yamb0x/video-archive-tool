# Overview & Goals (v1 Scope)

This tool is a Windows desktop app (Tkinter GUI) that ingests a ProRes master video and an optional R&D folder, then exports a structured, Webflow-ready archive.

## Key Objectives
1. Simple GUI — minimal steps to run.
2. Consistent folder structure and naming.
3. High-fidelity exports (x264 default, NVENC optional).
4. GPU acceleration for speed.
5. Clear logs and metadata for indexing.

## Workflow
User → selects ArtworkName + Date → Master ProRes → R&D folder → Output root → Cut Detection → Review timeline (merge/deselect) → Export → App builds:
- Masters
- Video-clips
- Stills
- R&D  

with HQ + Web versions, embedded metadata, and a `process_log.txt` summary.

## Performance
Uses ffmpeg for all decode/encode/frame operations (`-hwaccel cuda` when available). JPGs derived from HQ PNGs, clips from the master ProRes. Non-critical failures are skipped/logged; master failures halt the run. Config is hybrid (`config.yaml` editable + GUI sync).
